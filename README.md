<h4>How it works:</h4>

At the top of the page is a short introduction explaining the dashboard. If you want to know transfer data for a specific league you can do so using the 'select league' dropdown menu. Users can also investigate our series of pie charts, row charts and line graphs which will allow users to answer questions such as,  which transfer windows are most popular? Which positions are the most transferred? How much is spent on transfers every year? or What transfer types are the most common? When clicked upon the dashboards graphs will each update and adjust in accordance to the piece of information you have selected.

<h4>Technologies Used:</h4>
